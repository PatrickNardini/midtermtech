	<h1>Too Much For Timmy</h1>
	  <p>
    Too Much For Timmy is a motorized story board that is meant to visualize how homework affects stress showing the character Tiny Timmy as a personification of a persons good feelings (hope, happiness, etc).
    Mr. Mean is a personification of not just teachers but their homework and assignment of it. The motorized storyboard (which wasn't completed) shows the homework crushing Tiny Timmy which is a sort of metaphor
    for how homework destroys a persons mental health and how the stress caused by it can deeply affect someone. These clay models are a visualization of what it feels like. Tiny Timmy is crushed by the homework; students are crushed by homework.
    The only difference is one is physically and one is mentally.
